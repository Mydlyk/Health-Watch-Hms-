Health monitoring syetem (Health Watch) is the implementation of an engineering thesis project carried out in a team of three people. The main purpose of the work was to create an app to help doctors monitor the health of theirs patients. Therefore, we have developed a mobile application that reads and analyses the patient's vital signs taken from the smartwatch. Data from the smartwatch was downloaded using the Google Fit Api service. The Backend of the application was created in java, the Database in MySql and the Frontend in the React Native framework. In the project, I was responsible for the Health Watch frontend.
